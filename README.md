# Meraki Offline Mode Prototype

This project aims to develop a prototype for the Meraki website (https://www.merakilearn.org/) that seamlessly operates in offline mode. The goal is to design a user-friendly interface and functional modules that provide value even without an active internet connection. Users should be able to navigate the website, access relevant content, and perform key tasks offline

## Problem Statement
The Meraki website is a valuable educational platform, but its usability is currently limited to online usage. This project addresses the challenge of making Meraki accessible to users even when they have no internet connectivity. The key objectives are:

- Offline Accessibility: Develop a prototype that allows users to access critical functionalities of the Meraki website even when they are offline. This includes browsing content, viewing lessons, and interacting with educational materials.

- Data Capture: Implement a mechanism to capture user data and interactions within the website while offline. This includes tracking user progress, quiz scores, and any other relevant data.

- Synchronization: Create a proof of concept for data synchronization. When the user's device reconnects to the internet, the captured data should automatically synchronize with the backend server, ensuring that no user progress or interactions are lost.

## Technologies Used
- Workbox:  is a set of JavaScript libraries and tools that simplifies the development of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and enhances the offline capabilities of web applications. PWAs are web applications that offer a more app-like experience to users, including offline access, push notifications, and the ability to install them on a user's device.

- React: is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications
